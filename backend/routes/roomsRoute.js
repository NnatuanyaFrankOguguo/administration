/*ROUTER.POST In summary, router.post is essential for handling POST requests on the server side, 
allowing you to define how the server should process and respond to data sent by clients.
Request Handling: The function typically processes the data sent in the request body (often JSON), 
performs some operations (like interacting with a database), and sends a response back to the client. */

/*ROUTER.GET Request Handling: The function typically retrieves and sends back data to the client, such as rendering
 a web page or returning JSON data. GET requests are used for retrieving data or resources from the server.
  Itâ€™s commonly used for serving web pages, returning data in JSON format, and handling requests with query parameters.*/
